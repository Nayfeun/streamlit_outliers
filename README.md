# To do:
Update doc
Graph should disappear when switching tab (Check if pages could be better than tabs)
Improve Series distribution by using Distribution.data instead
Split outliers type 
Implement adjusted MAD

# Goal:
On a new page/tab, allow user to generate a distribution after choosing distribution and outliers parameters
