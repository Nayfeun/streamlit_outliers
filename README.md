# To do:
Update doc
Make one graph function for each page
Implement adjusted MAD in formulas
Sometimes only 1 red bar is shown when selecting MAD or IQR. Find a way to make them always visible. 
Allow user to chose between histogram and KDE plot. User should be able to select the number of bins for histogram, and bandswith for KDE. 

# Goal:
On a new page/tab, allow user to generate a distribution after choosing distribution and outliers parameters
